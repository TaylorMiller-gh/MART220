**TinkerCad**

TinkerCad is an awesome tool! A major barrier for working on electrical engineering stuff is the need for physical components. TinkerCad is a virtual environment equipped with any and every component necessary to perform EE. The website features premade tools for simulating basic circuits, arduino and microcontrollers. These virtual components are paired with a simplistic code block system that simplifies the coding process. Users familiar with C++ can choose to use scripts as well. TinkerCad is a great way to plan out and test circuits in a consequence-free environment. Personally, I've been wanting to start making microcontrollers to automate things in my life. I've been working with a friend on different designs for making small-scale digital mining equipment and home garden regulators. TinkerCad can clearly help to accomplish all of this - I'm excited to run away with it after this semester hahaha.

I had some experience with microcrontrollers and breadboards at MT Tech. The use of code blocks paired with text is a really powerful resource. I have so many questions about elcetrical engineering, logic boards, and embedded C, so seeing all of this really clears some things up.
