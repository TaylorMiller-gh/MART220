Wall Project Ideas

1. A simple Midi Controller for making music.

   The scope of this project would be simple at first. The controller would have 5 or so buttons that could be set to keys, synth, or vocal samples. Maybe the board would come with sample drums and a bpm that is adjustable. If we can get away with it, a feature that records and loops input would help expand the possibilities of the board. Some sort of audio-visualizer would be really cool as well.

2. Pong or Pacman

   UM/Montana themed pong or Pacman. Pacman could be a Grizzly bear and the powerups are huckleberries. Visually and audio effects could make the Pong build more interesting and challenging. Pong also encourages people to interact and play together.
