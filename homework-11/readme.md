# Week 11

I haven't been the biggest fan of WEBGL, but this week changed my mind. I chose to import a model of a car rim I did awhile back and surround it with the glorious Tim the Toolman Allen.  I hope it isn't problematic that I just used HTML for the title instead of using the P5 WEBGL solutions.
