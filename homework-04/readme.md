# Week 4

This week was really cool. I've done plenty of animation work in 2d and 3d environments, but I had never tried to handle an animation with code. To be honest, I had absolutely no idea how to really accomplish this. Initially, I wanted to load an array with object classes, each being added with the path to the image. But how can I update that image path for the next spot in the array? I tried adding the for loop counter into the path name, and figured I would just name the images appropriately: object[i] = new object(x,y, animationFrame + 'i') or something. It wasn't really working out at all. The example's 'getImage' class function is what really made it come together for me. The way the example uses the preload to manually load the array makes way more sense as well. Also, using the draw function as a for loop and controlling the interval was a 5000IQ move. Ultimately, I wouldn't have solved this week's homework without the example, and I completely understand if my grade depreciates accordingly.

The problems we went over this week sincerely challenged my understanding of how classes and functions can be used. It seems like classes are just arbitrary objects that hold data and use function calls to return those values.
