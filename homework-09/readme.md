# Week 9

This week was really cool. Webgl is kind of frustrating. I wanted to perform basic mouse events on the 3d objects and found out that is a much more difficult task than I anticipated. I looked at various '3D picker' scripts before deciding I will not be doing that right now hahah. The ray tracing example on P5 is really cool - I just don't think I'm up to that speed quite yet.
