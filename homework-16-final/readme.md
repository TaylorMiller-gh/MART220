# Week 16 - Final


I decided to take on something outside of my 'game design wheelhouse.' I'm glad I did - this was super fun and super challenging. Ultimately, it's not what I wanted haha. Of course, I was hoping to get away with some professional level midi-controller with drum kits, loop pedal, and various key sets. There was just no chance haha. I started with a big scope and managed to shave it down to this.
