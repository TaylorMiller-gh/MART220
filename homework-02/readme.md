# Week 2

Wall Project (First Iteration)

This project turned out to be something! I've had so much fun tearing through the
P5 documentation and libraries, trying to find potential solutions to this. It's
just a mountain of buttons for now I guess. There honestly isn't much more that needs
to go into it - just handling the audio and loop functions. This will probably cause the
overall structure to shift around a bit. I'd like to optimize the structure regardless -
I just needed to get it all 'onto paper' and decided not to mess with optimization
until there is a fully functional version/prototype.

I understand this code does not have all of the specified requirements for the
assignment (eg moving objects, if statements). I am entirely dedicated to making
this project fully functional on the "Wall." As such, those instances have not yet
arisen within the code. I'm sure I'll need switch statements or if statements in
the near future, I'm just not that far along yet.
