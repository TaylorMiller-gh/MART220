# Week 3

Wall Project (Second Iteration)

I wasn't able to get as much done this week as I wanted to. I went to test audio files and kept receiving an error about loading local files. The internet suggested I set up Node.js to preview the index file. I also kept getting a strange error whenever I used the preload function. I tried to load in an image for a logo - I can't remember what it said. We have a different assignment for the next week, so I'll try to find a solution to these problems. If not, I'll schedule a spot on your calendar and hopefully we can figure it out.

While looking through how to accomplish this task I found some really good news and some fairly bad news. P5.sound has audio-visualizer tools built in to it, so that portion of the program may come to fruition. The bad news is I haven't found any decent ways to build the loop buttons. I still need to set up the main output for the track and keys, and I won't be too shocked if I can't get away with the loop buttons.
