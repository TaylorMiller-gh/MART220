# Week 15

NFTs are an interesting concept. In this case, I think most digital scarcity is being made in bad faith - eg a lot of bad actors trying to make a bunch of money. I'll probably stay out of them for now. Anyway, working with pixel data was awesome! I wish I had more time to try and do something a little more creative. I wanted to do a palette-shifting piece for the animation but there was no way I was going to get it done in time. Oh well :)

Not sure if this is what you meant by 'block letters for my initials' or if you wanted me to save the frames into the assets folder every time the page is loaded in order to make a continuous animation every time the page is loaded.
